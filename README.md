# Machine Learning Classification Project

### This repository contains a quarter-long project completed for PSTAT 131: Statistical Machine Learning at UCSB in Winter of 2022. The goal of this project was to analyze a dataset of my choosing and build the most effective machine learning model to predict the outcome of either a classification of regression problem. 

### Specifically, this project looks at predicting the classification of stellar phenomena as stars, galazies, or quasars based on photometric data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey through exploratory visual analysis, model setup/building, and performance evaluation.

### Note: Working with such a large dataset caused the parameter tuning and model fitting to take an unusual amount of time, so these object were stored as .RData files and later loaded into the Markdown file to improve runtime. However, these files were too large to import into GitHub, so the Rmd file may not run if downloaded. Instead, refer to the HTML or PDF files to see this project in its entirety!
