# Machine-Learning-Classification-Project

### This repository contains a quarter-long project completed for PSTAT 131: Statistical Machine Learning at UCSB in Winter of 2022. The goal of this project was to analyze a dataset of my choosing and build the most effective machine learning model to predict the outcome of either a classification of regression problem. 

### Specifically, this project looks at predicting the classification of stellar phenomena as stars, galazies, or quasars based on photometric data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey through exploratory visual analysis, model setup/building, and performance evaluation.

### Please, refer to the Predicting Stellar Classifications PDF file for further background and citations as well as the analysis itself!
